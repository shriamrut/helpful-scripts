## gemini-cli-custom
Quickly kick start Google's gemini CLI agent in a isolated docker container (**Note:** Currently only verified in Apple silicon docker desktop, for other OS's, hope lets hope it works!). Running or trying out agents in isolated containers, is the safest way to ensure none of the system data which are private, gets used / consumed for making Gemini API inferences)
